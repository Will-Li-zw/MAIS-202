1.	Project and dataset
My project will be to predict the chance of a person to have. The dataset I chose is from Kaggle, called: “Cardiovascular Disease dataset, The dataset consists of 70 000 records of patients data, 11 features + target.”[1] 。

2.	Methodology
1)	Data Preprocessing and machine Learning Model
I’ll use the 11 features of people and try to find different features’ weight on people’s possibilities to have the disease(using the training section of the data). Then I will use the valid set of data to test my model and facilitate it considering the percentage of correct prediction. Then I will test the best model using the test data set, and figure out the correct prediction rate of this model. 


2)	Final Conceptualization
I can use this model to predict the chance of a person whether having disease based on his or her 11 features. Also, from my model, I can conclude most significant factors that lead to the cardiovascular disease.
