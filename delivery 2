MAIS 202 - PROJECT DELIVERABLE 2 

In my project, I will predict whether a person have the cardiovascular disease based on he or her 11 features. 



The dataset I choose consists of 70 000 records of patients data, 11 features + target.
For every patient, there are 3 types of input features [1]:
•	Objective: factual information; 
•	Examination: results of medical examination;
•	Subjective: information given by the patient.
Features:
1.	Age | Objective Feature | age | int (days)
2.	Height | Objective Feature | height | int (cm) |
3.	Weight | Objective Feature | weight | float (kg) |
4.	Gender | Objective Feature | gender | categorical code |
5.	Systolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_hi | int |
6.	Diastolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_lo | int |
7.	Cholesterol | Examination Feature | cholesterol | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
8.	Glucose | Examination Feature | gluc | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |
9.	Smoking | Subjective Feature | smoke | binary |
10.	Alcohol intake | Subjective Feature | alco | binary |
11.	Physical activity | Subjective Feature | active | binary |
12.	Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease | Target Variable | cardio | binary |
To process my data, I’ll first check if there are outliers or incorrect data in the dataset. Then, after cleaning the data, I’ll divide the data into two parts, 60% for training, 20% for validation and 20% for testing. Because I have fairly small amount of data, I’ll try to use higher dimension of the feature. Because I have a lot data, and small amount feature, I will use logistic regression or SVM without a kernel to improve accuracy.

I’ll use 4 models to train the data, logistic regression, random forest, SVM, and Naïve Bayes (more if I learn something new in class).
For naïve bayes model, because the model assumes all data are independent, I decide to combine some clearly strongly linked data together. According to the height and weight, I will calculate the BMI of a person. Then, analyze the two blood pressures and classify people to 3 categories: normal, warning, and high blood pressure.
I’ll use the valid data set to find the best parameters for my models, and then compares three models together to find the smallest logistic loss using the valid data. Then, I will use classification evaluation methods to determine the performance of my model (TP+TN/(TP+TN+FP+FN))
